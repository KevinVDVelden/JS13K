<h1>Welcome to Visible & Co!</h1>

<p>Here at Visible & Co we pride ourselves on using the best guards and the best Thievery Deterrent Systems (TDS&copy;) money can buy!<br />
Unfortunately the client you have been assigned to did not pay for that tier of support so you'll have to make do.</p>

<p>As you may have heard congress has recently passed a law making the maximum prison sentences for thievery limited only by how many items the would be thief has on them when they are caught.<br />
Our subsidiary Prison Inc is very happy with this news, of course it <i>is</i> illegal for us to try to lure thieves in to get more money and as such we recommend you catch intruders as soon as possible!<br />
<small>Longer sentences would however look good on your monthly review, so if it does <i>happen</i> that a thief penetrates far in to our defenses before getting caught, well, that's just the nature of things.</small></p>

<p>Here are the important things you must recognise and know to be an efficient thief catcher:</p>

        </td><td><b>A guard.</b><br />
            <p>These stallwart defenders of the law have the best training that 4 evenings of nightschooling can supply!</p>
            <p>When an alarm is triggered they will go over to it to check it out. Alternatively you can send them to a place you choose by using the "Alert" button and clicking on a tile.<br />
            If the guard is close enough they will check it, in both cases if nothing happens the guard will return to their station after a short while.</p>
            <p>If they stand next to a thief that thief will be caught and teleported to lockup.</p>

        </td><td><b>A thief!</b><br />
            <p>These scoundrels and thrill seekers want nothing more than to steal your (clients) stuff.</p>
            <p>Mostly bored people with some mail order catalogue gadgets they will enter from one of the entrances and loot stuff until they get bored.<br />
            The best way to keep your "guests" entertained is via the use of some TDS&copy; devices as explained below.</p>

            <p>When bored or scared they'll start heading towards the exits, catch them before they leave!</p>
            <p>Boredom increases when nothing interesting happens to a thief, certain things cause a thief to become more afraid, this will slowly decay over time.</p>

        </td><td><b>Loot!</b><br />
            <p>Thiefs will try to steal this, if they escape with the loot it is lost forever.<br />
            If a guard captures a thief carrying loot they will bring the loot back to it's proper place.</p>

        </td><td><b>Exit</b><br />
            <p>Thieves will exit from here, they will be disabled for a while if an Alarm DTS&copy; goes off nearby.</p>
    </td></tr>
    <tr><td>
            <img offset="448 0" />
        </td><td><b>Alarm TDS&copy;</b><br />
            <p>All TDS&copy; tiles can be triggered in one of 2 ways. A thief stepping on it, or a connecting alarm going off.</p>
            <p>All triggered devices will affect the original victim, so an alarm will call guards to the originally triggered tile.</p>
            <p>After use, a TDS&copy; becomes momentarily disabled.</p>
    </td></tr>
    <tr><td>
            <img offset="384 0" />
        </td><td><b>Freeze TDS&copy;</b><br />
            <p>When triggered, this will momentarily freeze the unlucky victim, making them easy targets for guards.</p>
            <p>This will slightly decrease a thief's boredom</p>
    </td></tr>
    <tr><td>
            <img offset="0 64" />
        </td><td><b>Zap TDS&copy;</b><br />
            <p>When triggered, this will cause a big jolt to the victim, making them feel alive and slightly singed.</p>
            <p>This will greatly decrease a thief's boredom, but will also scare them!</p>
