<h1>Welcome to Visible & Co!</h1>

<p>Here at Visible & Co we pride ourselves on using the best guards and the best Thievery Deterrent Systems (DTS) money can buy!<br />
Unfortunately the client you have been assigned to did not pay for that tier of support so you'll have to make do.</p>

<p>As you may have heard congress has recently passed a law making the maximum prison sentences for thievery limited only by how many items the would be thief has on them when they are caught.<br />
Our subsidiary Prison Inc is very happy with this news, of course it <i>is</i> illegal for us to try to lure thieves in to get more money and as such we recommend you catch intruders as soon as possible!<br />
<small>Longer sentences would however look good on your monthly review, so if it does <i>happen</i> that a thief penetrates far in to our defenses before getting caught, well, that's just the nature of things.</small></p>

<p>Here are the important things you must recognise and know to be an efficient thief catcher:</p>
<table>
    <tr><td><img offset="0 192" /></td><td>A guard.<br />
            <p>These stallwart defenders of the law have the best training that 4 evenings of nightschooling can supply!</p>
            <p>When an alarm is triggered they will go over to it to check it out. Alternatively you can send them to a place you choose by using the "Alert" button and clicking on a tile.<br />
            If the guard is close enough they will check it, in both cases if nothing happens the guard will return to their station after a short while.</p>
            <p>If they stand next to a thief that thief will be caught and teleported to lockup.</p>
    </td></tr>
